"""
All right , as we saw in the last lesson and coding exercise that if
we want to print things on different line then we actually had to 
write them few times like if we want to print / display this:

Hey
EveryOne
What's
Up

we will have to write it like this in python:

print("Hey")
print("EveryOne")
print("What's")
print("Up")

another method is to use escape sequence here which will allow us to 
write the above in one line.

escape sequance is \n --- backslash n for new line.

print("Hey\nEveryOne\nWhat's\nUp")
