Printing to The console

Now remember that the whole reason for learning to program is to able to tell computer ,what it needs to do and for it to follow/help us execute our task.

So lets go ahead and tell the computer to do something and we are going to that by writing our first line of code,in this case we are creating something called a print function.

	print()

syntax:
print(what need to be printed).
