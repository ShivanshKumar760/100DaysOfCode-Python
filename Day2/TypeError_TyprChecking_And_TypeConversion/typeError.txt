So now  What is Type Error ?

Lets understand using example,lets consider this peice of code.

print(len(123))

so here we are trying to print length of integer 123 and
here we can see the length of number 123 is 3 it has 3 digit .But when we run the above peice of code it wil give 
Error known as type error

	Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#0>", line 1, in <module>
    print(len(123))
TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len() 


something like this and this is because,len() function is 
used to determine the lenght of string data type and not integer 

So to avoid type error we need to do two things
	1)determine the type of parameter passed in function
	  using type() function

	2)Do type conversion
