Question 1:
Which statement below is incorrect?
	a)932 is an integer 
	b)"False" is boolean--incorrect
		"False" is a String, not a boolean. Booleans are either True or False. Booleans don't have quotation marks around them, otherwise it would turn them into a String. So it should be bool = False


	c)857.25 is float
	d)"523" is a string




Question 2:
What is the data type of the mystery variable?

mystery = 734_529.678

	a)integer
	b)string
	c)float--- correct
		Correct! Even though the underscore is there to make the large number more readable, because there is a decimal point it is still a Float. If you printed the number in your code, it would be stripped down to 734529.678

	d)boolean



Question 3:
I've put a spell on you. You are now a computer. If I give you the following code, what will you print out?

street_name = "Abbey Road"
print(street_name[4] + street_name[7])

	a)eR
	b)yo---correct
	c)ab
	d)None
