Mathematical Operator in Python Are :

1)Addition ---> +
2)Subtraction --> (-)
3)Multiplication ---> *
4)Division ---> / #this will always give float value
5)Floor Division ---> // #this will give integer value
  #terminating all trailing number after decimal

6)Modulo ---> % #used to find Remainder
7)Exponent ---> ** #to find exponential power of given number

Operator Precedence: Just like BODMAS in Math We have 
operator precedence in programming language 

PEMDASLR:
1)Paranthesis[()]
2)Exponent(**)
------------------------------------------------------
3)Multipication=division=floor Division=Modulo There Operator Precedence is same.(*,/,//,%)

So in case when a expression have two operator of same precedence we follow a rule of L To R ie the operator at
the left most will pe operatedfirst.
-------------------------------------------------------

4)+ ,- these two also have same precedence


Example :
exp=3*3+3/3-3 in this multiplication and division have same precedence and addition and subtraction have same precedence so the operator at left most will be operated first which is * then division and then +

9+3/3-3
9+1-3
10-3
7

and now if we use paranthesis like 

exp=3*(3+3)/3-3 in this case first the bracket part will be solved first

3*(6)/3-3 Now Multiplication 
18/3-3 division
6-3
3
