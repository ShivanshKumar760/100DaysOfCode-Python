So in Python we can assign variable any value using assignment operator "=".But Python also Offer augmented assignment arithmetic operator ,which combine the impact of an arithmetic operator with an 
assignment operator ,e.g if we want to add value of b to value of a and assign the result to a ,then insted of writing 

a=a+b

we may write :
a+=b


Similarly:
x+=y----->x=x+y
x-=y----->x=x-y
x*=y----->x=x*y
x/=y----->x=x/y
x//=y----->x=x//y
x**=y----->x=x**y
x%=y----->x=x%y
